    "text": "Functionally, Quarto (.qmd) is very similar to Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) or Rmarkdown (.rmd). It easily integrates with VS-code or other text editors. However, typically jupyter notebooks rendered in .html tend to be aesthetically lacking (i.e. ugly). Quarto allows you to create more professional and better looking documents. You can think of it as a generalization of .ipynb with added functionality on top (i.e. better internal and external cross-referencing, bib-tex integration, better document theming, etc). Outputs of .qmd can also be much more interactive, which we will utilize more heavily in DSAN-5300.\n\\(g(x)=x^n \\rightarrow \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}=n x^{n-1}\\)"
